# Forum-Website
This is a forum website that allows users to create their own accounts and start their own forums (coming soon).
This website uses MongoDB Atlas to store user data in the cloud database and uses bcrypt hashing function to
hash the user passwords for better security.

# What I Learned
* Program a backend server using MongoDB Atlas with user-authentication system.
* Integrate the bcrypt hashing function to encrypt user passwords for security.
* Solve the duplicate account problem and Mongo DB Atlas cloud database connectivity issues. 
* Develop a signup/login page with a practical user-experience design.
* Implement different JavaScript animations for a better user-experience.

# Testing - run the following
* npm install express
* npm install mongoose
* npm install bcrypt
* npm install ejs
* nodemon src/index.js to see the live server preview of the page.
